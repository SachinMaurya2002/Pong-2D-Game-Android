# Pong 2D Game

# Overview

Pong 2D Game is a modern take on the classic arcade game, developed in Java using Android Studio. This project is designed to offer a simple yet engaging gaming experience, where the player competes against an AI-controlled opponent. The game is built to be lightweight, responsive, and easy to play, making it suitable for a wide range of devices.

# Features

- Smooth Controls: Intuitive touch-based controls for easy gameplay.
- Dynamic Gameplay: The ball's speed increases with every rally, adding difficulty over time.
- Responsive UI: The game adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and resolutions.
- Pause and Resume: Players can pause the game and resume later.

# How to Play

- Objective: The main goal is to prevent the ball from passing your slider while aiming to score by getting the ball past the opponent's slider.

- Controls: Use your finger to drag the slider vertically on your side of the screen.

- Scoring: Each time you succeed in scoring against the opponent, you earn a point. The first to reach a predefined score (e.g., 10 points) wins the game.

- Game Over: The game ends when either you or the AI reaches the winning score.

# Game Mechanics

- Ball Movement: The ball moves at a constant speed, which increases slightly with each successful rally.
- AI Opponent: The computer slider is controlled by an AI that predicts the ball's movement and adjusts accordingly. The AI difficulty is balanced to provide a fair challenge.
- Collision Detection: The game uses precise collision detection to ensure realistic interactions between the ball and the sliders.
